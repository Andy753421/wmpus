.SH CONFIGURATION
Wmpus supports a simple ini-like configuration file stored in the users home
directory. Currently supported configuration options include:
.SS Main section
.TP
.B no-capture\fR=\fI[01]\fR
Do not arrange pre-existing windows. Same as \fB-n\fR
.TP
.B border\fR=\fIN\fR
Border width in pixels to draw around windows. X11 only, default 2. Same as
\fB-b\fR
.TP
.B margin\fR=\fIN\fR
Margin in pixels between windows for wm-wmii. X11 default 0, Win32 default 15.
Same as \fB-m\fR
.TP
.B stack\fR=\fIN\fR
Height in pixels for non-focused windows when the column is set to stack layout
.SH COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS
The windowing system backend and window management modes can be changed at
compile-time by linking in the correct object file. Supported windowing systems
include X11 (sys-x11.c) and Windows (sys-win32.c). Supported window management
modes include WMII like window management (wm-wmii.c) and a simple tags based
virtual-desktop manager (wm-tags.c).
.P
In addition several pre-processor settings are available which can be set in
config.mk or on the command line:
.TP
.B MODKEY\fR=\fIkey\fR
Modifier used for window management commands, can be either \fIalt\fR,
\fIctrl\fR, \fIshift\fR, or \fIwin\fR. Default alt
.TP
.B DEBUG\fR
Enable various debugging functions
.P
.SH WMII WINDOW MANAGEMENT
The wmii window management mode mimics the behavior of the \fBwmii\fR(1) window
manager. By default, the \fBalt\-\fR prefix is used for most window management
commands and is used along with the h, j, k, and l keys to focused different
windows.
.P
The \fBalt\-shift\-\fR prefix is used for moving windows and works similar to
changing the focus. The mouse is used for resizing windows and also for
changing focus.

The Win32 backend uses the existing window borders and title bars. It also
leaves a narrow space between the windows so that they look more natural in a
Windows environment.
