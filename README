wmpus - a cross platform window manager
=======================================
wmpus is a lightweight window manager for X11 and MS Windows


Instalation
-----------
Installing on X11:

    make
    cp wmpus /usr/local/bin

Building for Win32:

    make SYS=win32


Hacking
-------
The source code is organized around several generic interfaces coresponding to
the header files in this directory. The window manager (wm) and system (sys)
interfaces can have multiple implementations which are chosen at link time by
including the desired object file.

For example, sys-x11.c and sys-win32.c are mutually exclusive impelmentations
of the sys interface.
