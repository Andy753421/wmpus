wmpus - a cross platform window manager
=======================================
wmpus is a lightweight window manager for X11 and MS Windows


Instalation
-----------
Installing on X11:

    make
    make install

Building for Win32:

    make clean
    make SYS=win32


Running wmpus
-------------
Start wmpus from from an X11 init file, for directly if you so choose:

    X :0 &
    DISPLAY=:0 wmpus

External status bars such dzen or lxpanel should work well with wmpus


Hacking
-------
The source code is organized around several generic interfaces coresponding to
the header files in this directory. The window manager (wm) and system (sys)
interfaces can have multiple implementations which are chosen at link time by
including the desired object file.

For example, sys-x11.c and sys-win32.c are mutually exclusive impelmentations
of the sys interface.
